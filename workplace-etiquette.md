# Workplace Etiquette

## Evidence  
As part of the Work Readiness module, I completed a Workplace Etiquette activity to learn about professional behaviour in a real work environment. This activity focused on topics such as respect, communication, teamwork, punctuality, dress code, and appropriate behaviour in the workplace.

Understanding workplace etiquette is important because it helps build a positive reputation, maintain good relationships with colleagues, and create a professional image. This activity prepared me for what is expected in a real job setting.

Here is a screenshot confirming that I completed the Workplace Etiquette activity on Blackboard:
