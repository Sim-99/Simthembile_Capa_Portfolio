# Mock Interview

## Evidence  
As part of the Work Readiness module, I completed a Mock Interview to simulate a real job interview environment. This activity helped me apply my interview skills in a realistic setting, practice professional communication, and receive feedback on my performance.

I prepared for the interview by reviewing common questions, planning my responses using the STAR technique, and focusing on body language and confidence. I then recorded the interview and uploaded it for assessment.
