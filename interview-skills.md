# Interview Skills

## Evidence  
As part of the Work Readiness module, I completed an Interview Skills activity that helped me prepare for real job interviews. This activity focused on learning how to answer common interview questions, present myself professionally, and improve my confidence during interviews.

I practiced structuring my answers using the STAR technique and learned how to highlight my strengths effectively. This exercise helped me understand what employers are looking for and how to communicate my skills clearly.

Here is a screenshot confirming completion of the Interview Skills activity on Blackboard:
